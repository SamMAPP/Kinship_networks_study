# Kinship_networks_study

This repo contains the codes used to simulate the scenario studied in my Degree and Master thesis: "Statistical properties of kinship networks". Document available on: http://ricabib.cab.cnea.gov.ar/1053/

As a first step, it will be divided according to the chapter numeration.

WIP:
Review on folder: Semester Maestria 2/Trabajo especial/Python .
Analyze the file forced_distrib.py that must correspond to Real_popultions/numerical...

## Chapter 2 - Populations with controlled children assignation

Here we have variuos codes. On first instance, the code was written in C to generate files, and then a Wolfram notebook uploads the networks and computed the statistical properties. The results were then copied to an Origin template and plots designed.

IMPORTANT: Here we need to review the Wolfram notebooks in order to delete the ones used to exploration. Also, probably the C code has some modifications and need a depp revision.

## Chapter 3 - Variable size populations

## Chapter 4 - Real populations analysis
